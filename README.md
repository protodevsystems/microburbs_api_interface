## Logging

The backend server includes comprehensive logging to trace data flow:
- Request reception logs
- API call logs
- Response status logs
- Error logs
- Data type and structure logs

All logs are printed to the console where `server.py` is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to fetch data"
- Ensure the backend server (`server.py`) is running
- Check that port 5000 is not blocked by firewall
- Verify internet connection for API access

### Error: "401 UNAUTHORIZED - Access Denied"
- **This is an API limitation, not a bug in the code**
- The Microburbs API with "Bearer test" token has restricted access
- Some suburbs (like "Sydney") are not authorized with this token
- **Solution:** Try suburbs in NSW like:
  - ✓ Belmont North (confirmed working)
  - Newcastle
  - Lake Macquarie
  - Other regional NSW suburbs
- The app displays helpful error messages with suburb suggestions

### Error: "No data available"
- Check the suburb name spelling
- Some suburbs may not have data in the API
- Check server console logs for API response details

### Other API Errors
- **404:** Suburb not found - verify spelling
- **429:** Rate limit exceeded - wait before searching again
- **500/502/503:** API service temporarily down - try again later

### CORS Issues
- The proxy server should handle CORS automatically
- If issues persist, ensure flask-cors is properly installed
